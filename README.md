# Split polygon
Draw a line to split the polygon in 2.
<br>
<br>
I used an algorithm from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line%E2%80%93line_intersection) to find the point of intersection of two line segments.
The polygon is split at the points of intersection, based on where you draw the line.
